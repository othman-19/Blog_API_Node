# PROJECT: Blog API with Nodejs

This project will be a great way to practice and see the benefits of creating an API only backend.

One backend consumed by two different front-ends for accessing and editing the blog posts. One of the front-end sites for people that want to read and comment on posts while the other one will be just for user to write, edit and publish posts.
